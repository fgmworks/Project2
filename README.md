Background
Dataset:  CDC Tobacco Usage

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
From 2011 to 2017 a random digit dialing system was used in each state
30K records
All respondents are 18 and over, and non institutionalized



Hypotheses
The introduction of e-cigarettes/vaping has reduced the number of cigarette smokers


Method
ETL - MySQL
Visualization - Plot.ly
Framework -HTML, Javascript, D3



Visualization
DEMO




Problems and Solutions

Finding a dataset-government based data tends to be rich
Understanding the data
Null values
Omit data
E cig data only covers 2 years
Building a connection between the back and front end




Conclusions

E-cigarettes appear to cause a decrease in smoking but not in smokeless tobacco but increased total tobacco users
It appears that there is no impact on the frequency of use (every day vs some days)
Percentage of users for youngest group decreased
number of total users appears to be consistent throughout the years regardless of the survey being randomized


Future Directions

More visualization on different dimensions
APIs
Other db connections such as MongoDB
